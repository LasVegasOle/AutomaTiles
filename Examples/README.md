##AutomaTiles Examples##
The following examples are written using the AutomaTiles API for the Arduino IDE.

###Instructions for using the Arduino IDE w/ AutomaTiles###
1. copy the AutomaTiles folder into your Arduino directory i.e. ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/
2. launch or quit and relaunch Arduino IDE
3. in the top menu, go to Tools > Board and select AutomaTile
4. open an example and press the checkmark to make sure it compiles
5. Use an ISP of your choice and program your AutomaTiles!

###Examples###
**Game of Life**
Based on John Conway's Game of Life, this example follows a simple set of rules to emerge some very complex behavior. Different AutomaTile arrangements create multiple static and dynamic equilibria

**Forest Fire**
A forest fire simulation based on Nicky Case's Simulating the World in Emoji. Each tile represents a plot of land that can grow a tree, be struck by lightning, and catch on fire. Fires spread, Trees grow back, can you create the most resilient forest?

**Fracture**
A game that capitalizes on simple rules and thinking with your hands. Fracture is a competitive game for diversity. Each player has a color and they are trying to make all of their (6) tiles happy, represented by blinking. To make a tile happy, it needs to have at least 2 neighbors and only be touching colors different from itself. Players move by "fracturing" the board into 2 parts and reconfiguring it to make themselves more diverse and their opponents less diverse.

**Rock, Paper, Scissors**
A simple ruleset that results in a trippy chase of colors. Looks quite similar to a BZ-reaction.
