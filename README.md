# AutomaTiles
AutomaTiles presents a new way to interact with cellular automata. In a physical form, each tile can be manipulated, and progresses based on an external metronome or user input. The same intimate knowledge a movie editor has with a film is shared with computation, as the user can control the speed at which the system evolves and handle individuals as they respond to input.
