// look at all present tiles
// create an array of all combinations of starting points for the tiles 2^n
// init tiles at each starting point
// step forward until all off, board repeats its state for 2 times, recording its period
    // i.e. a clover has a period of 1
    // i.e. a blinker has a period of 2...
// count # of ways that the end state is dead (all off)
// count # of ways that the end state is static equilibrium
// count # of ways that the end state is dynamic equilibrium

// report properties of arrangment
    // surface area (num on perimeter)
    // # of 6 neighbor, 5 neighbor, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
        // yields density or sparseness
    //

// find bounding box of an arrangment
